    <h1>About HER!</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome all! This serves as our about us page, here we will give a general look at the Peoples
        family and more specifically my mom: Sagittarius Peoples. She has always shown a genuine interest in helping others, she often
        characterizes herself by her empathy, compassion, and a strong sense of altruism. Such a person as she, finds fulfillment in
        making a positive impact on the lives of those around them. Whether it's volunteering for community projects,
        lending a listening ear to friends in need, or actively seeking ways to contribute to the greater good, their
        passion for helping others is a driving force in her life.
